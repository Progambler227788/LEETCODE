Squares of a sorted array:
Like you say,
-1,0,1,2,3
square will be positive
maximum square will be at last so start from last

-4,-1,0,3,10

compare abs(-4) and abs(10)

SQUARES:
so store 100 at last of new array. right -=1

now,
-4 with 3.

now store 16 at second last of array. left+=1

now, -1 with 3. 

now store 9 at third last of array. right-=1

now, -1 with 0
now store 1 at fourth last of array. left +=1

now, 0 with 0, 
so 0 at first index of new array.

abs(left) and abs(right)
