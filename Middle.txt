Using slow and Fast Pointers
 1   2  3  4
 At step 1, slow and fast will be at 1
 At step 2 , slow will be at 2 and fast at 3
 At step 3, fast will be at null and slow at 3
 Middle will be 3.

So, we got for even linked list nodes we will have our
fast pointer at null and for odd our fast will be at 
last node before null
