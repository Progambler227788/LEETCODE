For distances,
we can store indices of specific characters first.

Then, what we can do is just use some pointer like
j that will give us closest indices.

like say my index of character is 3
and my array have 1,4..
so you can see next character is closer to me so 
that's why i'm gonna update j
because we are moving forward and we can 100% say
that next characters after 3 will be more closer to 4
because 3 is far away from 1 so that is a clue here
